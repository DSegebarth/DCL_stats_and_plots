# Interactive widget to compute statistics and plot your data

The purpose of this widget is to make everyday life in the lab a little easier, as it helps you to compute even complex statistical tests and to create
highly customizable plots that visualize your data. The widget also enables you to select exactly which statistical results you would like to annotate 
within the plots, so that you are directly ready to go for your next presentation!

## Next steps

1. Implement additional statistical tests
2. Implement additional plots
3. Implement additional customization options
4. Create a tutorial & documentation
5. Extend readme (version history, features that are currently implemented, screenshot / gif of the widget, ..)
