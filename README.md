# DCL_stats_and_plots

## An interactive widget to compute statistics and plot your data
---
This repository is part of the **DCLwidgets** series. 
These repositories are dedicated to foster the joint development of tools and resources by the [Defense Circuits Lab](https://www.defense-circuits-lab.com/). 
The intended use of each tool may vary greatly from very lab- and/or analysis-specific problems, to tools and resources that may be of use also for other researchers.
The common goal for each repository, however, is to provide the tool as an interactive, userfriendly, and intuitive GUI so that the user needs little to no coding expertise.

List of all repositories of the DCLwidgets series:
- [dcl_stats_n_plots](https://github.com/DSegebarth/dcl_stats_n_plots/): A widget to compute statistics and plot the data with several options to customize the plot
- [DCL_to_NWB](https://github.com/DSegebarth/DCL_to_NWB/): A widget to convert datasets acquired in the DCL into the NWB file format
- [BSc_MS](https://github.com/DSegebarth/BSc_MS/): A widget to annotate the corners of a maze within video files and save the corresponding x- and y-coordinates

## About this widget

The purpose of this widget is to make everyday life in the lab a little easier, as it helps you to compute even complex statistical tests and to create
highly customizable plots that visualize your data. The widget also enables you to select exactly which statistical results you would like to annotate 
within the plots, so that you are directly ready to go for your next presentation!

Please get in touch if you have any feedback, questions, or feature requests for us!

## Next steps (in no particular order):

- Implement additional statistical tests
- Implement additional plots
- Implement additional customization options
- Create a tutorial & documentation
-  Extend readme (version history, features that are currently implemented, screenshot / gif of the widget, ..)
