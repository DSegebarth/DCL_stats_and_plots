# DCLwidgets

Repository to foster the joint development of tools and resources by the [Defense Circuits Lab](https://www.defense-circuits-lab.com/). 
The intended use of each tool may vary greatly from very lab- and/or analysis-specific problems, to tools and resources that may be of use also for other researchers.
The common goal for each tool, however, is to provide the tool in an interactive, userfriendly, and intuitive GUI so that the user needs little to no coding expertise.

Please get in touch if you have any feedback or questions for us!
